# ConfirmWithCena
The official ConfirmWithCena iOS tweak, now open-source. Development has stopped, excluding compatibility updates.

# Why open source the tweak?
Because this was my first public tweak, and while I was learning there was no decent, small, simple examples for me to learn from.

# I've found an error, how can I help?
